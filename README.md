# NSFW AI Project

This repository is focused on exploring models and prompts for detecting or generating NSFW content using machine learning.

## Directory Structure

- `models/` — stores model files and weights (excluded from Git via `.gitignore`)
- `prompts/` — prompt examples for model interaction
- `.gitignore` — avoids committing large or system-specific files
- `README.md` — this file

## Goals

- Explore NSFW classification and generation tools.
- Build Colab notebooks for model interaction.
- Log prompt effectiveness and model performance.
